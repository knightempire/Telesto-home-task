## Heading 
Compressional to Shear Velocity ratio (Vp/Vs ratio) and its importance in formation evaluation and reservoir characterization in sandstone reservoirs



###### Authors: Amit Ray and Rajeshwaran Dandapani

##### Theory

P-wave (Compressional) and S-wave (Shear) velocities for homogeneous, isotropic rocks are expressed as


Where k is bulk modulus, µ shear modulus and ρ density of a rock.

Although the actual rocks are not isotropic and homogeneous, elastic equivalency exists between the two to a great extent in Layered media when the velocities are approximated as Interval, Average and RMS.

Velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) and Acoustic Impedance (AI) can be expressed as

##### Hydrocarbon effect on Vp/Vs ratio and AI

Let’s discuss how hydrocarbons impact Vp/Vs ratio and AI in the sandstones. Hydrocarbon bearing sands exhibit a decrease in Vp (due to significant reduction of bulk modulus and a moderate reduction of density), but a little increase in Vs (due to a reduction of bulk density). Consequently, the combined effect is considerably lower Vp/Vs ratio in the hydrocarbon bearing sands. This is pictorially illustrated in Figure

##### Significance of Vp/Vs ratio in reservoir identification

Now, we will discuss how Vp/Vs ratio behaves in (i) under-compacted and un-consolidated gas sands (ii) moderately compacted and consolidated hydrocarbon sands and (iii) highly compacted hydrocarbon sands relative to the encasing background shales and helps in detecting these sandstone reservoirs.

1. In the case of mildly-consolidated gas sands, usually found at shallow depths, both Vp/Vs ratio and AI exhibit lower values when compared to the encasing shales, since Vs in shales is very much lower when compared to sands due to their low rigidity modulus and high densities when compared to sands at shallow depths. In this case, both Vp/Vs and AI help in detecting these gas sands. (Class 3 AVO anomaly)
2. For moderately consolidated gas sands, Vp/Vs ratio exhibits lower values when compared to the encasing shales. However, AI of sands exhibit approximately similar values (overlapping range of values) as of the encasing shales. Hence, Vp/Vs ratio acts as an important parameter in detecting these types of gas sands. (Class 2 AVO anomaly)
3. In case of highly compacted hydrocarbon sand, Vp/Vs ratio again exhibits lower values compared to the encasing shales. However, AI exhibit higher values for these gas sands relative to the encasing shales. Here also, Vp/Vs ratio significantly help in detecting these type of gas sands. (Class 1 AVO anomaly) (Caution: Vp/Vs ratio contrast, between sands and shales at these depths and levels of compaction, acts more as a lithology indicator than fluid indicator)

##### Rock Physics analysis – a prerequisite
However, for effective application of this attribute to reservoir identification and subsequent use in seismic reservoir characterization, we should carry out a rock physics study and cross-plotting analysis using rock physics template (RPT). This will provide a clear understanding of what range of Vp/Vs ratio, we are expecting for the reservoir units and other formations in the study area. This will also help in linking the reservoir properties with Vp/Vs ratio and other elastic parameters and subsequently converting these elastic parameters from pre-stack inversion data.
